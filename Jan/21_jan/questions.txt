1)Normally array start with 0th index,
but in next version of php (8.0) arrays starting with nagative index so what is the need of nagative index ?


2)What is the diff between following code?

$a = [1, 2, 3, 4];
print_r($a);

$a = array(1, 2, 3, 4);
print_r($a);

3) In which situation we are using require or include??
